3rd gear during first few minutes of driving .\\n5     The transmission is horrible, it shifts revs horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move & scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .\\n6

                                                                                    All the staff go the extra mile to assist in anyway they can and the staff of the ajoining Cafe Pescatore are just as welcoming, with great service and the food is excellent .\\n29                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate at the Italian restaraunt located in the hotel and the food and service was outstanding .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Never experienced the room service .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Service was all good, albeit a bit stoic .\\n32                                                                                                                                            Unfortunately we didn't get to dine in the hotel restaurant, but I'd say it would be good, if the after hours service is anything to go by !\\n33                                                                                                                                                      I'd highly recommend the Tuscan Inn based on location, cheerfulness of staff, aesthetics in the room and general overall service .\\n34

seemed to be busy with guests giving info and advice .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                         There was also a gentleman offering massage at this time and we met a few people who had enjoyed his services .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The food and service were both excellent .\\n38                                                                                                                                                             This was probably not the best pick for us as we don't like tourist areas and Fishermans Wharf if one big tourist service .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                               There are many public transportation options including the cable cars, the trolley line and bus service .\\n40                                                                                                                                                  The highlight of this hotel for us was the service offered by the staff, particularly the two concierges on duty while we were there .\\n41

             One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !\\n43                                                                                                            Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .\\n44                                                                                                               At this point I asked to be put through to Best Western Customer Services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                       They state that there is an obligatory service charge for tables of more than 6 .\\n46                                                                                                                             We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   We were very impressed with the service we received .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The concierge service is second to none .\\n49                                                                                                                                          Tuscan Inn has it all, exellant location,very close to public transport, very clean, impeccable, friendly service and a supermarket opposite .\\n50                                                                                                                                               We found a great breakfast place just around the corner in Taylor St, called Darren's Cafe, good prices with excellant food and service .\\n51

quick .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                              very clean,well maintained,with efficient,if not overly friendly service .\\n53

                                                                                                                                                        I'd say that,as far as the evening   wine service is concerned,if you happen to be in the hotel,it's fine .\\n55

                                                                                                                                       Overall, the stay at The Tuscan Inn was great and would highly recommend due to the room service .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                                      There are other hotels in the area who do not offer room service .\\n58

good .\\n59                                                                                                                                                     The restaurant in the hotel ,  Cafe Pescatore ,  does the breakfast run for room service, it was adequate but a little overpriced .\\n60                                                                                                         Lunch and dinner room service is provided by North Beach Pizza, which deliveries many Italian specialties including pasta, entrees, salads, sandwiches and of course ,  pizza .\\n61                                                                                                                           However, there are countless restaurants of all sorts and price ranges within a 1, 4 block walk of this hotel, there is little reason to order room service .\\n62

service, and they are open 24 hours .\\n64

                             While I love the design, the poor components, sub, par fit, and, finish, poor quality control, and unreliable work on the part of dealership techs will make me question

everyone else .\\n4

3rd gear during first few minutes of driving .\\n5     The transmission is horrible, it shifts revs horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move & scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .\\n6

the staff, particularly the two concierges on duty while we were there .\\n41

             One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !\\n43                                                                                                            Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .\\n44                                                                                                               At this point I asked to be put through to Best Western Customer Services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                       They state that there is an obligatory service charge for tables of more than 6 .\\n46                                                                                                                             We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   We were very impressed with the service we received .\\n48

breakfast place just around the corner in Taylor St, called Darren's Cafe, good prices with excellant food and service .\\n51

quick .\\n52

                                                                                                                                                        I'd say that,as far as the evening   wine service is concerned,if you happen to be in the hotel,it's fine .\\n55

                                                     There are other hotels in the area who do not offer room service .\\n58

                             While I love the design, the poor components, sub, par fit, and, finish, poor quality control, and unreliable work on the part of dealership techs will make me question the quality of any future Toyota vehicle .\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                                         I love the car's visual and aesthetic design, but quality is just as important and for that reason, I would NOT recommend the new Camry to anyone !\\n70

two people guests who were less than polite to the hotel staff .\\n34                                                                             If you walk in feeling entitled with your nose up in the air like they owe you something, then I daresay you might find something to squawk about, but the hotel staff I encountered doesn\\u0092t sound anything like the staff some reviewers have mentioned .\\n35

                   It also does not offer an option to view the route as a series of turn by turn directions .\\n3

                                        The widescreen is a plus and I highly recommend it, even though it has the wide screen you can stick it in your back pocket which can be conveniently used for walking directions .\\n5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Garmin's nuvi 255W   is a handy little device that provides excellent value, but more importantly spot on directions .\\n6                                                 While I recommend that you refrain from entering a directions request while driving your car, I note that some of the more impressive features of this GPS are literally one touch away, and so mounting the device close enough to you to activite a one touch feature would seem to be relatively important .\\n7                                                                                                       But leaving it on the seat next to you is likely to cause a few double takes because as comfortable as you think you're going to be just listening for directions, the fact remains that the graphics will attract your eyeballs like a moth to a flame .\\n8

major metropolitan areas to be excellent .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               but for the most part, we find that the Garmin software provides accurate directions, whereever we intend to go .\\n10                                                                                                                                         Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I like how the Garmin 255W doesn't make you type in complete directions when it isn't necessary .\\n12                                                                                                                                       The only other annoyance of any time is that if you deviate from your route and don't indicate that you are detouring, you get to hear the Garmin repeatedly chastize you because it has to recalulate your directions .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   No more firing up the computer, going to the site, printing the directions .\\n14                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     It speaks the directions so that you don't have to keep looking down at a piece of paper .\\n15

     Saves mobile phone minutes, because you don't have to call and ask for directions .\\n17

less intrusive than on some other brands .\\n18

                                                         The sound is tolerable, but when you are hearing spoken directions a lot, it gets really annoying .\\n20

                           Depending on what you are using it for, it is a nice adjunct to a travel trip and the directions are accurate and usually the quickest, but not always .\\n24

be a technological idiot but I figure this out, right out of the box and I hadn't even read the directions yet, , this is major easy .\\n25

      Shows you your current latitude and longitude location, and allows you to enter new coordinates to set up so you can get directions to that location .\\n29                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            If you missed the spoken directions, you can look at the top of the screen for written directions .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         However, I much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .\\n31

of the verbal directions :\\n32                                                                                                                                                                        It should tell me to take the Southwest Drive exit, or the Buffalo Gap Road exit, like the highway sign says, or like I would verbally tell someone to take if giving them directions .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            So, although the Nuvi doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Directions seemed to focus on Interstate travel and I have not played with the device enough to know if it can be set to avoid Interstates .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                       It lost satellite contact a couple of times on the trip   but apparently picked them up again because there were no skipped directions .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Directions were easy to see and understand .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The spoken directions are generally easy to understand .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Since the directions are also displayed on the screen, I find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   It does know when you are not near a public road but it cannot give directions to the road .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The spoken turn, by, turn directions are clear and very timely .\\n41   My only real gripes on the software interface side would be its inability to show 1, way streets on your overhead map   and that this particular model does not support the Garmin routing feature that you can sync between your PC and their more expensive models to pick multiple waypoints instead of just a point 'A' to point 'B' directions system .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You can even get turn, by, turn directions from the program, and Google Maps has features that work with Garmin units .\\n43                                                                                                                                         Any time you're facing a closed roadway or are terribly stuck in highway traffic, you'll get a very slick change in directions to your destination given to you in literally less than 5 seconds than you ask for it .\\n44

                 button, and it gave us directions right to Carmel .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The purpose of the GPS is to give me directions in unfamiliar locations .\\n46

                                                                                                                                              It takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .\\n48

deliberately not following its directions while driving one day in downtown Sacramento .\\n49

bad directions in one place in Sacramento .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                     I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                        I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It loads quickly, have pretty accurate directions, and can recalculate quickly when I miss a turn .\\n53

to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n54

some approaching streets .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                     I am sure I've not even touched upon the many features this GPS boasts, but for basic travel directions for the non, techie then this is a great product .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          My daughter would then call my wife, asking her to plot a course using a mapping Web site and recite the directions .\\n57                                                                                                                   Daughter Dearest now carries the Nuvi in the glove box of her car, pulling it out, plugging it in, and getting directions whenever she needs, in a manner that notably is much faster and clearer than reading a map or calling her mother .\\n58

When it comes to directions, I'm horrible .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\n60

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      It worked so well that people from the wedding were following me for directions .\\n62

providing directions and keeps up with the speed I am traveling .\\n63                                                                                                                                    The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Amazon had the best price for this model which I chose for its ability to adjust the directions if you reroute, text to speech feature and 4 .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    For the first time in several years, my husband & I took a roadtrip with no  squabbling  about directions .\\n66

and maps are easy to use, and if you miss a turn, it updates your route in seconds .\\n67

accurate directions for roads and streets .\\n68

.\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                                              What the 255w does best is find a street address, business, point of interest, hospital or airport and give you turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy .\\n71

find with my usual combination of maps and Web, based directions .\\n72

the highway was wrong .\\n73                                                                                                                                                                                                     Wish I had bought it about two years ago rather than spend a lot on maps and wasting time asking directions, especially in relatively remote areas of ME .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I spent 2 weeks driving around the Mid, West following Mapquest maps and directions .\\n75

of the fall foliage without worrying about using a map for directions or getting lost .\\n76

when street signs are obscured or missing  .\\n77

.\\n78

the right mounting spot, it s like it's not there until you need it and then it's there waiting for you to with all the directions to get you to your destination .\\n88

                                                 After a certain amount of frustration dealing with paper maps, missed exits and fumbling for directions in the dark ,  I decided it was time to get on

                                            Also, there is there no asking for directions from passengers like spouses and children who have difficulty reading conventional paper maps .\\n92

                                  Others have said that the voice directions leave something to be desired in terms of volume and clarity .\\n93

          It was accurate on determing original directions and recalculating when necessary .\\n94

to hear the directions using just 70% of volume .\\n95

                                                     I ordered room service one night, and the food was delightful, and the service was fast and friendly .\\n18

                                 Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                There was a massive queue for the restaurant, the food was beginning to run low we went down at 9 .\\n21

                              Room service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a

                                                 You could buy food from Sainsburys or Waitrose which were 2 minutes away to save money .\\n24

 Note that all around the hotel are decent little cafes and shops to get either full breakfasts or breakfast foods .\\n27

restaurant food but fast with good service .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                              There was an adequate self service buffet, not a huge selection or very well presented, cloths were not changed when food got spilt .\\n29                                                                                                                                                                             Not exactly what most tourists are looking for but when you have been out of the states as long as we have you eat fast food when you get the chance !\\n30

used to have mini, fridges .\\n31

one of the buffet style breakfasts so lukewarm food and very busy .\\n36

                                       I would recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .\\n43

it's convenient for that .\\n45                                                                 Within 200 yards of leaving the hotel and heading to the Tube Station   you have a number of fast food outlets, highstreet Restautants, Pastry shops and supermarkets, so if you did wish to live in your hotel room for the duration of your stay, you could do !\\n46

taste was good but became boring after the 3rd day the food served wasnt changed .\\n47

that night .\\n48    The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n49

                           When the food arrive   it was the wrong order .\\n50

.\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  While travelling out of London to any of the popular destinations, food can be pretty expensive .\\n52



were reasonable and food was excellent .\\n56

                                                 The bed was very comfortable, and the empty refrigerator was a great place to store food and beverages .\\n60

                                                              Avoid the food in the hotel restaurant as it is ridiculously overpriced .\\n63

                          Minimall with Boots pharmacy, Whole Foods type ritzy fullservice market, coffee shops, etc .\\n66

                                                                                                                       there are a variety of priced places to eat in the immediate area, but the food costs are always high,  we ate mostly at pubs, where the beer and scotch were very reasonably priced always !\\n69

assorted cold cuts to please every taste .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                                                             Another good thing is that the rooms have mini, fridges and it's great for storing ready, to, eat food from Waitrose .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                 they mark down their food at the end of the day and you can get great deals on everything from sandwhiches to desserts at a fraction of the cost .\\n72

purchase it .\\n30

The price for new hardbacks on the Kindle is great too .\\n32

                                                                                                                                                          The ability to plug in headphones and play Miles Davis to drown out the screaming kid while you are reading at the doctors office is priceless .\\n34                                                                                                                                                       If you are searching for a REAL review on the Kindle 2 by someone that was waiting to receive it rather than complaining about price or other issues then here it is .\\n35                          However, I will say, the selection of inexpensive books has been worth the purchase price of this item  especially for those that enjoy reading the classics or nationwide news, it has been a joy to purchase entire collections for a fraction of the cost of purchasing new or even used books .\\n36

will likely find the convenience and savings well worth the price .\\n37

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             To justify the purchase price, those functions really need to be there .\\n39

is pretty hard to beat, too .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                            I was a little miffed when i saw that they would now be charging for the Kindle cover, which was included in the price for the previous version .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                              Mind you, it's the same size as the Kindle 1, and that of most book pages, but I for one dream of something larger without a larger price tag .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                 If I have to spend the full puirchase price on the K2 with a K1 still in hand I would have probably waited .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Although pricey, the real value of this purchase is that it got me to read again .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                        But, as far as my reading experience with the kindle 2, I have downloaded so many books and all at a fraction of the original price .\\n45

                                                                                                              Yes, it costs extra, but they lowered the price on the Kindle 2 so that buying the basic cover costs plus the purchase price of the device itself equals the cost of a Kindle 1 .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                         But given my book storage issues and how much it would cost me to rent a bigger apartment here in the City, I didn't mind paying the current price .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                            That may not be true for everyone, but, as I said, I'm sure the price will eventually come down .\\n49

pay for delayed convenience especially where I am located .\\n50

it is way too pricey .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The subscription prices and book prices are really good from what my wife tells me .\\n54

the cover was included in the K2 price, it is still worth buying .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                  It is pricey but if you buy as many books as I do, it will pay for itself within a year due to the low cost of most books .\\n56

device itself is the only drawback but if your an avid reader like myself the reward far outways the price .\\n57

proposition makes up for it   .\\n58

it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n35

down .\\n39

                   After 2 weeks, it has yet to make a mistake, and is always completely accurate ,  even to the point of telling me which side of the street my destination is on .\\n41

more out of a book I'm reading with my eyes and hearing the voice of the storyteller in my mind .\\n42

                     With the great technology of electronic ink, there isn't any back, lighting pounding relentlessly like the desert sun on your tender eyes .\\n49

The Kindle does not have a screen that taxes the eyes, and allows me to shift some of my time away from the computer for blogs that I would normally read online .\\n52

how tired your eyes may get .\\n53                                                                                                                                                     I do think the e,

                                                The screen size is close enough to the size of a paperback book page that it hasn't caused my eyes any problems .\\n55

E, Ink display is easy to read and doesn't strain your eyes and reads better than a printed page .\\n57

                                             The screen is less obtrusive than the white of a book page, which also helps my eyes from growing tired too quickly .\\n64

                                            I previously owned a 98 Avalon, and found the seats more comfortable than the Honda .\\n8

                 I'm very sad ,  I loved my daughter's Civic and the dealer service is fantastic, but even good service can't help the uncomfortable seats .\\n10

                                                             The only for sure complaint I have is the seats seems to hurt my back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

                       Seats are very comfortable and ride is very smooth !\\n32

front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36

It is very close to Gloucester Rd tube station, has plenty of restaurants, pubs, supermarkets, chemists within 100 yds, is close to Hyde park for a run walk in summer, near Kensington High street,

on the tube and when we heard about it on our own and asked the concierge for help with getting to the airport, he advised taking a cab service for 50 pounds plus banking holiday surcharge, , we luckily found a cheaper alternative by ourselves .\\n136

that every day, they offer wine and beer from 5, 6pm for free for all hotel guests .\\n65

enjoyed the nightly 'manager's reception' when wine and nibbles are freely available !\\n67

                         Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n70                                                                                                                                                   The staff were friendly and the free coffee and biscoti each morning and wine at 6pm each evening were occassions when one could meet other guests .\\n71

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Free wine and mingle from 5 to 6pm .\\n73

                                                                                                                                                                      There was a free wine tasting that the hotel put on that we were, unfortunately, too jet, lagged to participate in .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                    Every evening 5pm to 6pm, guests are invited to have free wine in the reception area and there is free coffee there every morning .\\n76    The hotel's evening wine hour and morning's biscotti hour also distinguish the property as a cut above, and our group, which has stayed at many a biz hotel, had no problem whatsoever  in fact, a courtesy upgrade got us a fine meeting space with free internet, which even impressed our boss .\\n77

a great winter deal , $99 for a room with king, size bed and free parking   .\\n79                                                                                                                                                                               Overall, we would recommend this place to friends, especially if they are able to get a good discount and free parking .\\n80

that the bottles of water that they have in the rooms sell for $6 which I think is rediculous .\\n60                                                                                                                                            There were no king rooms available when we checked in and the woman at the front desk was not overly helpful until we produced a copy of our confirmation wtih the king bed request on it .\\n61                                                                                                                                              very nice pool and spa on the 42nd floor, rooms and lobby were clean, easy walk to Michigan Ave through via the lower level walkway to the Illinois State center, beds were comfortable .\\n62

         Large rooms and excellent service .\\n90

                                                                                                                                                                                                                         But the rooms are large and nicely equipped with all the essentials of a business hotel .\\n92

great views and mine was no exception .\\n93

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The Fairmont and Hyatt next door have a few rooms with a view but not many .\\n95

had them book me using hotels .\\n96

                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Contemporary in its decor, the rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are very nice .\\n98                                                                                                                                                                                                                    For 2 nights there were 4 of us and for the last night only 2, so I was looking for 2 rooms or a room with 2 beds .\\n99                                                                                                                                        I originally booked 2 rooms because their online reservation site would only allow you to book a room for 1, 3 people and there was no guarantee that you would get a room with 2 double beds .\\n100                                                                                                                                the service staff always left our rooms clean, and even arranged my girlfreinds jewelry for her, untangling her necklaces and earrings from each other, and leaving them evenly placed on the bureau !\\n101                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The rooms were clean, and upscale for the low price we paid .\\n102

                                                                                                                                                                                                      The rooms were very spacious and clean, especially for downtown Chicago standards .\\n104

rooms were quiet .\\n105                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The rooms and common areas were bland and far from a top flight hotel .\\n106                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The hotel is really pretty, but the rooms need some upgrading to be considered anywhere near a 4 5 star hotel .\\n107                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I would say the best part about this hotel was that it was very very quiet from inside the rooms .\\n108                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The decor of the rooms and the communal areas is really dated, looks like it hasn't been touched for years .\\n109                                                                                                                                                               The Swissotel was a great place to stay, rooms were very clean, and quiet at night for a great nights rest, with extremely comfortable beds, and high quality bedding .\\n110                                                                                                                 We had a pretty bad view on the 27th floor relative to the other rooms which faced Lake Michigan   There's some construction right now Southwards and we stared at a giant mud pit with big cranes the entire visit .\\n111                                                                                                                                               So, in all, I would definitely stay hereagain, even though the service stinks, the restaurantis for rich patrons with money to blow and the peopleare snobs, the rooms make up for it .\\n112                                                                                                                  Some of the other hotels in the same class in Chicago might be a little more decorative or chic but their rooms are not as comfortable and don\\u0092t seem to have the same dependable amenities that the Swissotel has .\\n113                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Rooms were good, nothing spectacular about them except the views .\\n114                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The beds were extremely comfortable, rooms were extremely spacious and the bathrooms were as well .\\n115                                                                                                                                           We didn't check out the normal rooms but my parents were in a &quot normal&quot  room and loved it, and said it was one of the nicest and most importantly cleanest they'd been in lately .\\n116                                                                                                                                                       From talking to other guests, I concluded that rooms ending with numbers xx1, xx2, xxx19 and xx20 should be avoided unless you enjoy listening to elevators going up and down !\\n117                                                                                                                                                                                                                  One thing that struck me as backward is that they charge $10 per 24 hours of internet usage in certain guest rooms .\\n118                                                                                                                                                                          I pointed out to the manager that my firm held a conference there just months before and had used the conference facilities as well as several hotel rooms .\\n119                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Honestly, I would rate the service and location a three, the rooms a four, and the view a five !\\n120

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Pro's ,  I so wanted to love the small size, long battery life, brilliant blue color and light weight .\\n19

          Small, easy to grab and go, and can do your business in places that wouldn't open a full size laptop, easy to take notes on, or keep copies of what your working on from your main PC and continue working on it where ever you are .\\n22

                                          I needed this for a business trip because my full size laptop needs service .\\n46

        This netbook is great and I love its small compact size and ultra portability .\\n47

a store to personally try the keyboard and screen size .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                         although the screen is relatively small to my eyes   it wasn't really hard to get used to the size and the screen is clear and bright, no prob reading articles and writing essays .\\n49

.\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                                                Also tried a full size Logitech Trackman   and a little wired Logitech notebook mouse sucks like all mice but usable if a mouse is your idea of a good time .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I'm using it with a Xion 2 fan pad that folds up to about the size of the closed netbook and runs off a USB port .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The screen is very sharp and readable even with the tiny text at this size .\\n53

can't beat the price with a stick compared to a full size laptop or desktop .\\n54                                                                                                                                                      The small size makes it very easy to carry compared to a standard laptop, the long battery life is really great, and the speed and performance using various wi, fi connections was better than I expected it to be   .\\n55

feels like the big one .\\n56

screen should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .\\n60

                I love the lightweight, small size of this product .\\n61

how they made keyboard as large as possible unlike Qosmio 17  which is almost same size .\\n67

play great, 700mb files look fine on this size of screen .\\n68

                                               I love the feel of typing on it, and have not had any issues transferring from a regular, sized keyboard to a smaller one .\\n71

rough on my electronics, and the ASUS has handled a few rough tousles with textbooks in a bag slung into my car seat without any problems .\\n72

 years old, so the screen size was also a concern, but it is adequate for the type of things I use it for .\\n73                                                                                                                                         As soon as you connect the VGA cable to an unknown projector and press the function key for projection, it automatically adjusts the size and resolution to fit the projector even if it cannot display properly on its own screen .\\n74

perfect in full size and proper aspect ratio .\\n75
